Subject: [PATCH] modules: include <linux/stdarg.h> when available

Workstation/Player code changes between 16.1.2 and 16.2.0 added some
includes of <stdarg.h> which is interpreted as regular (userspace) header
file in /usr/include. Shortly before that, mainline commit c0891ac15f04
("isystem: ship and use stdarg.h") added minimalistic kernel version of
stdarg.h to avoid including userspace headers from kernel code. As the
kernel version is sometimes included via other header files, build against
5.15 kernel results in a lot of warnings (about redefined va_* macros).

Include <stdarg.h> when building against kernel < 5.15 and <linux/stdarg.h>
when building against kernel >= 5.15.

Subject: [PATCH] modules: fix stddef.h include

After mainline commit 04e85bbf71c9 ("isystem: delete global -isystem
compile option") in 5.16-rc1, vm_basic_types.h in both vmmon and vmnet
does not find (userspace) stddef.h any more. As it should not include this
header anyway, fix the include directives to include stddef.h from kernel.

Kernel version of stddef.h has been available since the beginning of git so
that it is safe to include it regardless of kernel version.
